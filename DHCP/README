The purpose of this example is to show how DHCP server works. 

Start the simulation.

Go to the console of the main machine (right-click on the background and select xterm).
From the DHCP directory (where this file is) start the script "start_dhcp":

# ./start_dhcp

This script sets up the clients and the server.

Go back to the Imunes GUI and start shell on the host pc3. Start the Ethereal (Wireshark) on pc3 and start capturing, with the "Update traffic in real time" option checked.

In the pc3 shell check the pc3 IP address:

pc3# ifconfig -a

Request IP address for the eth0 interface:

pc3# dhclient eth0

Now, check the address:

pc3# ifconfig -a

Stop capturing traffic. Check the packet trace.

First, check the DHCP release trace. What messages are transmitted?

Now, check how the client gets the IP address from the DHCP server. Identify those packets!

1. DHCP Discover 
 
- sent by pc3 with the source IP 0.0.0.0 (remember, pc3 want's new address, so uses 0.0.0.0 as the source, destination address is broadcast - pc3 has no idea who the DHCP server is

2. DHCP Offer

- DHCP server sends its offer, offering IP address, DNS servers, router, subnet mask

3. DHCP Request

- pc3 sends broadcast requesting the offered address

4. DHCP ACK

- DHCPserver approves the request for the address, defines the lease time (10 minutes in this example) and sends default router and DNS servers.
