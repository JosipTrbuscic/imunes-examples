The purpose of the example is to show what happens in the "quiet" network - how routers exchange information about their neighbours.

Follow the same steps as in RIP.imn. 

Analyse the packets which are transmitted.

*******************
*  OSPF1.imn
*******************

The purpose of the example is to show what happens after the router goes down, and then goes back up.

Follow the same steps as in RIP1.imn, using the following router commands:

show ip route - shows all routes
show ip ospf route - shows ospf routes
show ip ospf interface - show info about router's interfaces
show ip ospf neighbor - show info about router's neighbours

Notice the dead time in "show ip ospf neighbor" and check what happens after the router7 is shut down. Look at how the dead time changes.
