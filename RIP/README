The purpose of the example is to show what happens in the "quiet" network - how routers exchange information about their neighbours.

Start the simulation.

Open Ethereal on port eth3 on router3.

Open capture dialog. Check "Update list of packets in real time" option.

Start capturing.

After 30 seconds, you should have at least 2 UDP datagrams.

Stop capturing after approx. 1 min.

In the Ethereal, open one package. 

- what are the source and destination address?
- how often are the RIP packets transmitted?
 
Show the contents of the first package and check the RIP data.

Each datagram containes routes collected by the sending router, with the associate metric. Comment on the metric (number of hops).

Further work:

- during the simulation, open the router3 console and shut down the eth1 interface, simultaneously monitoring traffic on eg. eth2 router2. Watch what happens with the routes. 

- what happens after 180 seconds?

- bring the route back to life, while still monitoring the traffic on router2. what happens?

*******************
*  RIP1.imn
*******************

The purpose of the example is to show what happens after the router goes down, and then goes back up.

Start the simulation.

Open Ethereal on eth2 on router2 and start capturing the traffic with the "Update list of packets in real time" checked.

Open router console on router2 (right-click, shell window, vtysh) and type "show ip rip". This shows the routes that router2 has. Analyse the routing table - available networks, next hops and metrics, as well as the time in the rightmost column.

Now, stop router7 (right-click, stop). 

In router2 console watch what is happening, using "show ip rip" and "show ip rip status". Look at the time of last updates. When Last Update reaches 3 minutes, the "show ip rip" should show metric 16 wor the network 10.0.4.10. Meanwhile, try to ping or traceroute the server (10.0.4.10).

Watch what happens after 3 minutes. The network reconfigures and routing tables are refreshed when the new update packets arrive. Try traceroute from pc to the server. Which path do the packets take?

Next, start the router7 again (right-click, start). Show what happens with the routes. Try traceroute from pc to the server and comment on the route.
