# DMZ + DNS / Mail / WWW 
########################

This example is an extension of imunes-examples/DNS+Mail+WEB.

A new domain, mm.com is created on canvas mm.com and the appropriate
configuration files are modified or added to DNS, Mail and Web servers.

The whole mm.com network is behind firewall FW.
There are 3 servers in DMZ that can be accessed from Internet:
dnsMM - DNS server for mm.com (and relay for local hosts)
smtpMM - Mail server for mm.com
wwwMM - Web server for mm.com

Hosts in LAN part of mm.com are behind another firewall, FWint
that also performs NAT.
Hosts from LAN can access anything on Internet (and on DMZ).

Firewall rules are defined in FW.sh and FWint.sh.
-------------------------

The experiment can be started using instructions from the DNS+Mail+WEB
example (README_DNS+Mail+WEB). Firewalls are started (at the begining 
or at the end) using script ./start_fw.

Script start_all can be used to (re)start everything:

# imunes -b NETWORK.imn
# ./start_all

Script test_fw starts network scans from LAN, DMZ and Internet:

# ./test_fw
