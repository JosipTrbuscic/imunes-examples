On FreeBSD:

To activate IPFW without having to recompile a kernel add
the following lines to /boot/loader.conf:

net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
ipfw_load=YES

After reboot, ipfw will be loaded with default to accept.
If you had run "kldload ipfw" the default rule would be deny!

-----------------------
On Linux

"iptables" must be installed on Docker image:

# git clone https://github.com/imunes/vroot-linux.git
# cd vroot-linux
- add iptables to image/utilities.sh
# ./build.sh

-----------------------
Firewall rules for node FW are in FW-FreeBSD.fw and FW-Linux.fw.
They were generated by FirewallBuilder from FW.fwb.

Rules for FWint are in FWint-FreeBSD.sh (manually created)
and FWint-Linux.fw (generated by FirewallBuilder from FWint.fwb)
