Examples for the IMUNES network emulator.

IMUNES is a lightweight network emulator that runs on top of the FreeBSD kernel
which is used to create a virtual network topology by using FreeBSD
[jails](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html) and
[netgraph](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?netgraph%284%29).

To run the scenarios, after starting the virtual machine, just clone the git
repository into the machine and follow the instructions.

Additional instructions and explanations are available on our [wiki page](http://imunes.tel.fer.hr/trac/wiki/WikiImunesExamples).
